## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- Media query

### What I learned

The major lesson that this challenge provided me was, for sure, the importance of a good HTML structure. At some point in the middle of the challenge I had to take a step back and rethink my entire HTML because I couldn’t apply the styles in a proper way.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me with some doubts I had about media queries throughout this challenge.
